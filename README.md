          When using these programs I have it setup so all I have to do is call the program (ex: cat alive.txt | assetfinder or amass enum -df <input.txt>). The Go programs mostly allow for you to call them without including path. The programs I created you have a few options. You can" cd /usr/bin; vim or nano subs and copy code to subs; chmod +x subs or cd /path/to/ReconFlow; cp subs.py /usr/bin/subs chomd +x /usr/bin/subs; or change my code from ReconFlow.sh to call the program from path(ex: Python3 ~/tools/ReconFlow/subs.py 'input'
